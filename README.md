Learn Academy --Ruby Classes Methods and Properties Exercise--

    *Most of the ruby code was already written for this exercise. Our challenge was maily focused on writting the rspec. 
    *Besides the RSpec, challenge was to activate the dummy responses in the eliza_questions.rb
    *Bonus: If a user enters !, then the response should change to all caps (yelling mode). I was not able to complete this. I plan     to work on this again soon.


Languages and Tools Used:
    *Ruby and RSpec
    
To run: Must be ran in the console with ruby eliza.rb
